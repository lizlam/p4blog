# Perforce Blog Archive
Over the years, I wrote many blogs when I was working at Perforce.    
Unfortunately, they are all mostly suffering from link rot now.    
This is my archive of some of them thanks to the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/web.php).        
Not all the CSS is preserved on the Wayback Machine, but it's nice to at least have the text.
It won't mean much to most people, but for me this repo is like an old photo album.         
 
I look back on it fondly.
